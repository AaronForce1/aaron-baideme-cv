  - Employer: Hex Trust
    Place: Hong Kong SAR
    Date: April 2022 - Present
    Position:
      Title: Head of Platform and Infrastructure
      Summary: >
        Department Head for Platform and Infrastructure Team, reporting to the MD of Engineering, CTO, and CEO. Led a team of engineers to design, build, and maintain a large-scale, high-availability Kubernetes infrastructure. This includes setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters, integrating with cloud services, and ensuring robust security, scalability, and compliance. 
      Details:
        - "<b>Platform Engineering and Architecture</b>: Designed, Developed, Implemented, and Deployed a comprehensive infrastructure platform that supported all Hex Trust products. This platform was powered by Kubernetes at the core and focused on four key tenants of the Platform Engineering Team: Security, Scalability, Resiliency, and Delivery"
        - "<b>DevOps and CI/CD</b>: Implemented continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines within a Kubernetes environment, improving deployment speed and reliability."
        - "<b>Disaster Recovery & Resiliency Planning</b>: Designed and implemented a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, managing data backup strategies, establishing failover procedures, conducting regular drills and tests, and continually refining the plan based on results and incident data to improve recovery times, minimize data loss, and enhance system resiliency."
        - "<b>Security and Compliance</b>: Implemented security best practices and compliance standards (including, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and SOC 2) to ensure a secure and compliant infrastructure. Drafted policy and procedure documentation to establish a security-first culture and ensure compliance with the highest of industry standards."
        - "<b>Team Leadership</b>: Managed a team of 10 engineers, including hiring, training, and mentoring. Worked closely with the engineering team to ensure the infrastructure platform met the needs of the business. Worked to curate a culture of collaboration, innovation, and excellence. With the support of our Human Resources team, ensured a comprehensive goal and performance management process that aligned with company and department-level goals and strategies while also taking into account an individuals' passion and personal goals"
        - "<b>Project and Programme Management</b>: The Platform and Infrastructure Team established an autonomous hybrid Scrum-Agile process to manage epic/feature delivery, both alongside application and product milestones as well as independently iterating on our own components. Every feature and infrastructure deliverable was scoped with detailed project plans that outlined tasks, timelines, and resources. We diligently executed these plans to meet project and company goals."
      Accomplishments:
        - "<b>Hybrid-Cloud, Multi-Region Kubernetes Cluster Infrastructure</b>: Leveraging various technologies, including Cilium and Istio service mesh - Terraform (infrastructure-as-code) - and ArgoCD, we were able to deploy a comprehensive kubernetes cluster solution across AWS, GCP, and on-premise - linked together with advanced and secured private network topology to craft a highly available and responsive infrastructure/application platform"
        - "<b>Cross-Domain Solution</b>: Managed end-to-end procurement and building infrastructure from scratch to deploy an advanced digital asset custody solution that allows for realtime, and secured cold wallet storage and transactions with advanced features such as MPC (multi-party computation). Coordinated the project delivery alongside Blockchain and Cryptographic engineers to ensure this advanced, infrastructure-centric feature could be added a staple to the launch of Hex Safe 2.0"
        - "<b>Advanced GitOps Infrastructure Provisioning and Application Deployment Process</b>: From scratch, we developed terraform modules and a CICD process to accompany it that allowed us to scafflold kubernetes infrastructure from scratch - the required networking components, both internal to each cloud provider (AWS, GCP, on-premise) and the intra-networking VPN components to support a zero-trust environment for development and production. Leveraging ArgoCD we were then able to ensure that a base layer of applications (cert-manager, nginx, external-dns/secrets controllers) were standardised across every cluster environment; crafted an operator-application duo cluster paradigm to ensure additional resiliency and failover, migrating control plane components like Grafana, ArgoCD, and others to a backend, 'operator' cluster while the application was free to run independently and separately."
